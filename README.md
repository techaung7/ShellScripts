#Linux Shell Scripting - Getting Started
This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to get started with Linux Shell Scripting.

#Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux operating system and how to use the terminal. You should also have access to a Linux machine with a Bash shell.

#Step 1: Understanding the Shell
The shell is the program that interprets your commands and executes them. The Bash shell is the most popular shell on Linux. It is powerful and highly customizable.

To open a Bash shell, open your terminal and type:

bash
Copy code
$ bash
You should see a prompt that looks like this:

bash
Copy code
username@computer:~$
This prompt indicates that you are now in a Bash shell.

Step 2: Creating Your First Script
To create your first shell script, open a text editor and create a new file with a .sh extension. For example, you could name it myscript.sh.

Add the following lines to your script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
Save the file and exit the text editor.

Step 3: Making Your Script Executable
Before you can run your script, you need to make it executable. To do this, use the chmod command:

bash
Copy code
$ chmod +x myscript.sh
This command gives the user permission to execute the script.

Step 4: Running Your Script
To run your script, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and type:

bash
Copy code
$ ./myscript.sh
This will execute your script, and you should see the output:

bash
Copy code
Hello, world!
Congratulations! You have just created and executed your first shell script.
