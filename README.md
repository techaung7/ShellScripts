#Linux Shell Scripting - Getting Started
This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to get started with Linux Shell Scripting.

Step 1: Creating Your First Script
To create your first shell script, open a text editor and create a new file with a .sh extension. For example, you could name it myscript.sh.

Add the following lines to your script:

#!/bin/bash
Write Your Scripts 

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Step 2: Making Your Script Executable
Before you can run your script, you need to make it executable. To do this, use the chmod command:

$ chmod +x myscript.sh
or
$ chmod 755 myscript.sh
This command gives the user permission to execute the script.

Step 3: Running Your Script
To run your script, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and type:
$ ./myscript.sh
This will execute your script, and you should see the output:

Congratulations! You have just created and executed your first shell script.
